It's part of the reason that even MVP voters made him the AP1 Quarterback and made it clear that Lamar was the BEST player in the league last year, and it wasn't even particularly close. Josh Allen, they just felt, was more valuable to his team.\n\nThe only thing that hasn't made him absolutely a top 3 pure passer in the entire league right now is the deep ball touch. He has the power and hits deep passes when they are on a rope, but he struggles with consistency when he needs to add touch on those deep valls. That's probably the only hole in his game as a pure passer at this point. All of this is even crazier because im just talking about pure dropback, traditional passing. \n\nFor Burrow, it's the lack of elite arm strength and ability to make throws out of pressure (mostly due to lack of arm angles/arm strength to hammer a pass inaccurate off his backfoot) without taking sacks. Thats why you will see Burrow take alot of sacks... not even due to his offensive line, but because he is limited in his ability to throw out of them\n\nFor Herbert, it's trusting his arm a bit too much and forcing balls into his first read (not going through his progressions) because he knows his arm is that good and he can fit the ball in regardless and it likely wont lead to a turnover...but he isnt going through his progessions for possible big plays elsewhere. Etc. I could go on and on for every top QB.\n\nBut Lamar is just different... He is still by far the best running QB in the league, all the while being a top 3-5 talent as a pure passer with no running taken into account. I could go on and on, but you get it.

There’s good recommenders, and Matt had always proven to be a really good recommender. When he believed in a guy, it usually translated. And so Steve was very integral in that process.”\n\n>Additionally, **Lynch credited quarterbacks coach Brian Griese with putting Brock Purdy on the 49ers radar before the team ultimately selected him** with the No. 262 overall pick.\n\n>“The other guy I’d say was Brian Griese,” Lynch said. **“Brian was incredibly impressed once we kind of gave [Brock] to him and said, ‘Hey, get on these Zooms, start talking to Brock.’ And Griese came back extremely convicted. And then it’s in Kyle’s hands, it’s in my hands, and we start watching.**\n\n>**“And we were so smart, we waited until the very last pick to draft him, and thank God he was there.** He’s been tremendous for our organization, and you really could see it right away.”\n\nSo the Purdy hype started with Slowik, but he was just an area scout without much authority.

Shula once berated safety Glenn Kozlowski so badly in a game the veteran was found crying on the bench. Shula and Jake Scott shot f-bombs at each other like daily salutations. He cursed rookie linebacker John Offerdahl so roundly on a sideline the youngster went into the coach’s office and said he wouldn’t take it anymore.**\n\n>**You want a “collaboration” issue with a Dolphins quarterback? Let’s talk Dan Marino.

Do you understand a coach often is a lion tamer in his daily work? Does it make you wonder just what kind of an organization Ross is running when “communication and collaboration” issues — and not football issues — led to firing the coach?\n\n>Not every Dolphins coach used bad words. Cam Cameron, for instance. He had a no-foul-language rule. He once called in trainer Kevin O’Neill and asked him if he actually swore at a player. O’Neill said he did because the player had ignored three requests and swore at him.\n\n>Flores certainly is tough to get along with. The revolving-door of an offensive staff is well aware. But there’s no way in hell — oops, excuse the language — whatever Flores said in “disrespect” even to Ross ranks anywhere close to what Shula said to team owner Joe Robbie.\n\n>Shula didn’t refer to Robbie by name to people.

He regularly welcomed team staffers to the practice facility with one proviso — they couldn’t report anything to Robbie.\n\n>Shula, too, set the standard in all sports for a coach cursing a team owner.

One of the main issues is that sometimes, rushing attempts for negative yardage for a QB count as rushes, and sometimes they count as sacks. Since this is an attempt to evaluate all of a QBs play rather than rushing, I am going to define a ""general completion"" as either a pass or a run that results in positive yardage. This is a bit different than your standard completion, as you can get completions with negative yardage. However, for the purposes of this exercise, I felt that negative rushes or sacks shouldn\'t be counted as completions, and therefore am adjusting the definition of pass completions to also be for positive yardage. That means anything for no yardage (no net gain by the offense and the same result as an incompletion) or anything for negative yardage (worse than an incompletion) now counts as an incompletion. Let\'s see how this modified general completion (and corresponding completion % over all passing attempts, rushing attempts, and sacks) compares to the standard completion %. Note 3: Keep in mind that this changes the ""meaning"" behind completion %. It was originally used to have a very raw estimate of a passer\'s general accuracy. Now it\'s more seen as the chance that a QB, when given the ball, will gain yardage on the down.\n\n|Player|Cmp|Cmp%|Gen Cmp|Gen Cmp %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Josh Allen|385|66.50|462|64.71|\n|Matthew Stafford|326|62.60|326|56.99|\n|Brock Purdy|308|69.40|323|63.21|\n|Jalen Hurts|352|65.40|458|62.65|\n|Jordan Love|372|64.20|384|58.27|\n|C.J.

These are QBs that rush often, but not in the endzone, or for TDs. Surprisingly, Lamar Jackson is the most harmed here, shedding light on his runs being mainly in the middle of the field, not able to convert TDs directly. Russ, Mahomes, and Fields join Lamar in QBs that get hurt by this lens. \n\nSomeone like Gardner Minshew, who\'s not a big rusher, goes from **27th in TD%, to 7th in gen TD%**, since he very rarely rushes and the vast majority of the plays he directly influences are much more likely to work for a score than many mobile QBs.', '# Turnovers and TO%\n\nSince we\'re now incorporating rushing, I feel it necessary to incorporate fumbles into a total turnover stat as well. Both turn the ball over to the other team, and rushers can often be more vulnerable to fumbles (Zach Wilson was T-22rd in total interceptions, but 6th in total fumbles). Let\'s look at the total turnovers and TO % as compared to INTs and INT %.\n\n|Player|Int|Int%|Turnovers|TOs/Touch|  \n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|  \n|Josh Allen|18|3.10|25|3.50|  \n|Matthew Stafford|11|2.10|11|1.92|  \n|Brock Purdy|11|2.50|17|3.33|  \n|Jalen Hurts|15|2.80|24|3.28|  \n|Jordan Love|11|1.90|20|3.03|  \n|C.J.

As referenced above, Wilson is **16th in INT%, but 4th in turnover %.**\n\nTurnover prone QBs like Stafford, Howell, Mac Jones, and Josh Allen aren\'t as bad when you incorporate turnovers. Stafford goes from **13th to 29th in turnover %.**\n\nDesmond Ridder turns over the ball more than **once every 20 touches**. Oof.\n\n# Gen Yds and Y/A\n\nAnother simple one, basically just looking at the total yardage that QBs were able to acquire on their legs and with their arm (minus their sack yardage since a lot of negative runs count as sacks). This is where it starts to get really interesting to me, because especially when looking at Gen Y/A, QBs that might get praised for their rushing contributions when looking at their volume, might actually come out worse in the long run because traditional QBs who\'ll try to find a pass instead of running can end up averaging more yards per touch than those that rack up short runs.\n\n|Player|Yds|Y/A|Yards|Yards/Touch|  \n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|  \n|Josh Allen|4306|7.44|4678|6.552|  \n|Matthew Stafford|3965|7.61|3825|6.687|  \n|Brock Purdy|4280|9.64|4271|8.358|  \n|Jalen Hurts|3858|7.17|4241|5.802|  \n|Jordan Love|4159|7.18|4164|6.319|  \n|C.J.

No other QBs yards/play jumps higher than his when factoring in rushing and sacks. This is a rare combination of a QB who\'s able to rush well, sparingly when necessary, and avoid sacks. In fact, he\'s **11th rather than 18th in yards/attempt** when including rushing and sacks, giving a lot more positive context to his season than the stats seem.\n\nFields, Lamar, and Hurts are ""exposed"" by this stat. They have been lauded for their ability to rush, but while someone like Hurts has a passing Y/A that is **13th in the league, his overall yards/touch is 19th in the league**. This points to rushes, while seemingly efficient, not being as efficiency as a dropback pass compared to the rest of the league.\n\nThis is a good time to point out that Josh Allen accounted for 150 more yards than the next best QB (Tua).']"
